Note to user:
================================================================
This was my first time writing an addon for wow as well as writing code for the Lua programming
language. There most likely will be some bugs, but insofar the addon is usable for what I intended
and so I chose to release the first build. Feel free to let me know in a comment on the Curse page
if you find any bugs I'm not aware of.

As this was my first time learning to code an add-on I needed quite a bit of help from the WoW
forums, stackoverflow, and even some other addons I was able to use for reference in figuring out
how to attach frames to existing UI.

Thanks everyone who helped me and thank you to all who download my addon.

Summary:
================================================================
Adds more guild finder settings for sorting and filtering from the list of resulting guilds.

================================================================
Description:
================================================================
Guild Finder Enhanced attempts to tackle the weakness of Blizzard's original guild finder.
It does so by giving the user the ability to manage the huge list of recruiting guilds. With this
add-on, users are able to order the list of recruiting guilds alphabetically by name, numerically
by number of members, numerically by achievement points earned, or even stick with the
default list order. Additionally, users are be able to search for a guild by name (prefix) or even
search for guilds based on keywords found in their name and description.
